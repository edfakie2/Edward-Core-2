# Seed Sorting Machine Model
## Pre Coding machine coding

**Project by Edward Fakier**


### Business Problem:

-A large scale Agriculteral plant is interested in developing a machine that will sort Seed Types in seperate bins for processing
-Only a small amount of data was given to prove if its possible 


### Data:
- Raw Date can be found (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds)

## Methods
- After Scaling the data I found that KNeighbors with a PCA before was succesful at 96%
- After testing I found that a Keras Model to be the most effective for further use on more data and seed types 96% was achived here as well
-


## Results

## Recommendations/Limitations:

- This was only meant to test a potential system for later use
- Its my opinion that my results prove that such a system can be implemented very succesfully
- with more data and seeds I believe that it will be possible to get very close to 100% accuracy
